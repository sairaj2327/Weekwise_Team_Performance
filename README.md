# **Weekwise_Team_Performance Power BI Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**

**Project Title**: Weekwise_Team_Performance Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard tracks and compares weekly productivity, time utilization, and the total cases resolved by the L1 and L2 teams. The objective is to drive performance improvements by analyzing key metrics and visualizing trends, resulting in a 10% increase in overall productivity and a 30% increase in total cases solved.

## **Objectives**

1. **Data Import & Setup**: Import weekly performance data of L1 and L2 teams into Power BI and set up relationships between tables.
2. **Productivity & Utilization Tracking**: Visualize team productivity and time utilization to identify trends and areas for improvement.
3. **Cases Solved Analysis**: Track the total cases resolved by both L1 and L2 teams on a weekly basis.
4. **Quality Review Monitoring**: Visualize the percentage of L1 cases reviewed by L2 for quality assessments, highlighting the improvements in quality checks.
5. **Insights & Decisions**: Use the dashboard to identify trends and support data-driven decision-making.

## **Project Structure**

### 1. **Data Setup**

- **Data Source**: The Excel file contains four key sheets that provide weekly data on team performance.
  - **L1**: The first-level team handling initial case resolution.
  - **L2**: The second-level team that reviews the quality of L1's cases.
  
- **Key Data Fields**:
  - `Week`: Weekly time period.
  - `L1 - Cases Solved`, `L2 - Cases Solved`: Number of cases solved by each team.
  - `L1 - Time Utilization`, `L2 - Time Utilization`: Time spent by each team on case resolution.
  - `L1 - Productivity`, `L2 - Productivity`: Productivity percentages for each team.
  - `L2 - Cases Sample %`: Percentage of L1 cases reviewed by L2.

### 2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

- **Null Value Check**: Check and clean any missing or null values in the dataset.
- **Calculated Fields**: Create any necessary calculated fields for total cases solved, average productivity, and sample rates.

   - **Visualizations**:
     - **Line charts** to track weekly productivity and time utilization for both L1 and L2 teams.
     - **Objectives**: Visualize trends in team performance and time efficiency.
     - **KPI Example**: Show overall productivity for each team across weeks, identifying peak and low-performance periods.

2. **Cases Resolved**:
   - **Visualization**:
     - **Stacked bar chart** to display the total cases solved weekly by L1 and L2 teams.
     - **Objectives**: Compare the weekly case resolution rates of L1 and L2 teams.
     - **KPI Example**: Highlight the best-performing weeks in terms of case resolutions.

3. **Quality Review Metrics**:
   - **Visualizations**:
     - **Gauge chart** to monitor the percentage of L1 cases reviewed by L2.
     - **Objectives**: Track quality review consistency and improvements over time.
     - **KPI Example**: Show the increase in L2's quality assessments of L1 cases.

4. **Comparative Performance Metrics**:
   - **Visualizations**:
     - **Side-by-side column chart** to compare cases solved, productivity, and time utilization between L1 and L2.
     - **Objectives**: Highlight areas where one team outperforms the other, helping to identify efficiency gaps.
     - **KPI Example**: Comparison of L1 and L2 productivity percentages to assess operational efficiency.

5. **Trend Analysis & Insights**:
   - **Visualizations**:
     - **Trendline** showing the growth in total cases solved, time utilization, and productivity over time.
     - **Objectives**: Identify key trends and insights from data patterns over the weeks.
     - **KPI Example**: Identify the best-performing week and the week where productivity increased the most.
